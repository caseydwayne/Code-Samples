Code-Samples
============

###*A collection of various scripts with heavy bias towards PHP.*

 - **breadcrumbs.php** - creates a breadcrumb navigation based on the URL provided
 
 - **data.php** - a sample of 2 functions used in the Database Manager <br> <sup>(`global $db` is here for reference only. The real code uses class objects and handles multiple databases.)</sup>
  
 - **emailer.php** - converts form data into an email after validating/sanitizing input

 - **restaurant-filler-table.php** - distributes parties (for events) by company, grouping together as close as possible

I can also encapsulate using classes.
