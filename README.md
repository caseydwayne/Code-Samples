Code-Samples
============

###*A collection of various scripts with heavy bias towards PHP.*

 - **breadcrumbs.php** - creates a breadcrumb navigation based on the URL provided
 
 - **data.php** - an sample of 2 functions used in the Database Manager
  
 - **emailer.php** - converts form data into an email after validating/sanitizing input

 - **restaurant-filler-table.php** - distributes parties (for events) by company, grouping together as close as possible

I have tried to include code samples relevant to what we discussed (database exchanges, security, complex functions, etc). I can also encapsulate using classes, I just generally prefer to do this as a last step, and if necessary.
  
If you would like to see more PHP or samples of JavaScript, just let me know.
